# Movie-Recommendation-System

A simple movie recommendation system using Tkinter and SQLite.

The users view their personal movies list, view recommended movies, or browse other movies. 
1. Users can maintain (by adding movies to) a wishlist and a watchlist.
2. The recommendation system suggests new movies based on the users most-watched genre.
3. Users can also browse movies based on genres, rating, etc.

The frontend of the Movie Recommendation App is developed using Tkinter. The sqlite3 module is used for executing SQL queries to
perform operations on the SQLite database, such as inserting records into the watched_movies and wishlist tables.
